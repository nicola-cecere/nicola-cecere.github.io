I am an Applied Scientist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/), where I build and deploy large-scale machine learning systems to optimize global hiring decisions as part of the Intelligent Talent Acquisition (ITA) team.

Previously, I earned a **Double Master‚Äôs Degree with Honors** in Machine Learning and Data Science from **Politecnico di Milano** and **Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid** through the EIT Digital program. My academic track blended strong technical training with a focus on **innovation and entrepreneurship**, which deepened my interest in startups and applied AI.

My research spans **generative AI**, **uncertainty estimation**, **information retrieval**, **NLP**, **recommender systems**, and **LLM Optimization** with a hands-on emphasis on practical machine learning. I‚Äôve published multiple peer-reviewed papers and was awarded **1st place in the 2023 ACM RecSys Challenge**. I enjoy working at the intersection of applied research and scalable system design, especially in areas where **LLMs and retrieval-based architectures** meet real-world constraints.

I'm particularly passionate about innovation, early-stage product development, and using AI to solve real business problems ‚Äî often drawing from my experience contributing to AI-powered startup prototypes and RAG pipelines.
